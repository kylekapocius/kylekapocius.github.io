        I'll tell you a little about myself. My name is Kyle Kapocius. I was born in Brunswick, Maine, and I still live there! I have an older brother, Andrew. I have 2 cats from the same litter, and they have the same birthday as I do. My favorite tv show is Mad Men, and my favorite food is... well there are too many, I just love food.
