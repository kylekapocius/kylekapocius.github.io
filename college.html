        <H1>College Life</H1>

        <p> <A HREF="index.html"> Homepage</A> </p>

        
        	I go to <A HREF="https://umaine.edu/"> University of Maine</A> in Orono. I'm in my sophomore year. I chose UMO because I live in-state, so its cheap. I also chose it originally for its engineering program, but last semester I actually changed my major to marketing.
        

        
        	I feel like marketing is such a better choice for me. I have always been interested in engineering, but I feel like as a career choice, my personality fits better in the business field. Right now I'm thinking about going into sales. I'm already very excited to graduate and start my career!
