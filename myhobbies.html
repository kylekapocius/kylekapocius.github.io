        	I have many hobbies, many of which stem from my interest in engineering.
        

        
        	I love cars and sportbikes. I have a 2004 Yamaha R6, and a 2005 BMW 325i 5-speed standard (both pictured below).
        

    
        	My other smaller hobbies include photography and watchmaking.
